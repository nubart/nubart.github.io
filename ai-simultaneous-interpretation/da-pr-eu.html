<h1>DATA PROCESSING ADDENDUM (DPA) FOR "NUBART TRANSLATE"</h1>

<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 1 October 2024</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.1 (Last updated: 22 January 2025)</p>

<p>This Data Processing Addendum ("<strong>DPA</strong>") forms part of the Terms and Conditions ("<strong>Agreement</strong>") between:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The Customer (acting as "<strong>Controller</strong>") and</li>
  <li>The Service Provider (acting as "<strong>Processor</strong>"):
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Nubart GmbH</strong> (Berlin, Germany) -- for Customers in all territories except Spain, Italy, Portugal, Brazil, and Latin America; OR</li>
      <li><strong>Digital Tangible SL</strong> (Barcelona, Spain) -- for Customers in Spain, Italy, Portugal, Brazil, and Latin America.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>(Collectively, the "<strong>Parties</strong>")</p>

<h2>1. DEFINITIONS</h2>

<p>1.1. <strong>"Data Protection Laws"</strong> means all applicable laws and regulations relating to the processing of Personal Data and privacy, including the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 ("<strong>GDPR</strong>"), the UK GDPR, and any applicable national implementing laws.</p>

<p>1.2. <strong>"Personal Data"</strong>, <strong>"Controller"</strong>, <strong>"Processor"</strong>, <strong>"Data Subject"</strong>, <strong>"Processing"</strong>, and <strong>"Personal Data Breach"</strong> shall have the meanings given to them in the GDPR.</p>

<p>1.3. <strong>"Sub-processor"</strong> means any third-party processor engaged by Nubart to assist in fulfilling its obligations with respect to providing the Service.</p>

<h2>2. SCOPE AND RESPONSIBILITIES</h2>

<p>2.1. <strong>Role of the Parties</strong>: The Parties acknowledge that for the purposes of the Data Protection Laws, Customer is the Controller and Nubart is the Processor.</p>

<p>2.2. <strong>Scope</strong>: This DPA applies to the Processing of Personal Data by Nubart on behalf of Customer in the course of providing the Nubart TRANSLATE service ("<strong>Service</strong>").</p>

<p>2.3. <strong>Processor Obligations</strong>: Nubart shall:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
  <li>Process Personal Data only on documented instructions from Customer (including those in the Agreement), unless required to do so by applicable law;</li>
  <li>Ensure that persons authorized to process the Personal Data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality;</li>
  <li>Take all measures required pursuant to Article 32 of the GDPR (Security of Processing);</li>
  <li>Assist Customer in ensuring compliance with obligations pursuant to Articles 32 to 36 of the GDPR (Security, Breach Notification, DPIA), taking into account the nature of processing and information available to Nubart;</li>
  <li>Make available to Customer all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations laid down in this DPA and allow for audits (as detailed in Section 7).</li>
</ol>

<h2>3. SUB-PROCESSING</h2>

<p>3.1. <strong>Authorization</strong>: Customer grants Nubart general authorization to engage Sub-processors to provide the Service.</p>

<p>3.2. <strong>Current Sub-processors</strong>: Customer consents to the engagement of the Sub-processors listed in <strong>Annex III</strong> of this DPA.</p>

<p>3.3. <strong>Changes</strong>: Nubart shall inform Customer of any intended changes concerning the addition or replacement of Sub-processors. Customer may object to such changes within 14 days on reasonable data protection grounds. If the Parties cannot resolve the objection, Customer may terminate the Agreement with respect to the affected Service.</p>

<p>3.4. <strong>Sub-processor Responsibility</strong>: Nubart shall ensure that each Sub-processor is bound by written terms that provide at least the level of data protection required by this DPA. Nubart remains responsible to the Customer for fulfilling its own obligations under this DPA, including where Processing is carried out by a Sub-processor, but Nubart is not liable for events or failures outside its reasonable control.</p>

<h2>4. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS</h2>

<p>4.1. <strong>Processing Locations</strong>: Customer acknowledges that Nubart's primary processing infrastructure is located in <strong>Ireland (EU)</strong>, with additional processing performed by Sub-processors as detailed in <strong>Annex III</strong>. Some Sub-processors may be located outside the European Economic Area (EEA), including in the USA.</p>

<p>4.2. <strong>Transfers</strong>: To the extent that Nubart transfers Personal Data to a Sub-processor located outside the European Economic Area (EEA) that has not received an adequacy decision from the European Commission:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
  <li>Such transfers shall be governed by the <strong>Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)</strong> approved by the European Commission (Module 2: Controller to Processor); or</li>
  <li>Nubart shall ensure other appropriate safeguards are in place (e.g., Binding Corporate Rules, approved adequacy frameworks such as the EU-US Data Privacy Framework where applicable).</li>
</ol>

<p>Where Personal Data is transferred to Sub-processors located outside the EEA in a country without an adequacy decision, Nubart will ensure that such transfer is subject to appropriate safeguards under Chapter V GDPR.</p>

<h2>5. DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS</h2>

<p>5.1. Nubart shall, to the extent legally permitted and taking into account the nature of the Processing, assist Customer by appropriate technical and organizational measures to fulfill Customer's obligation to respond to requests for exercising the Data Subject's rights (e.g., access, rectification, erasure).</p>

<p>5.2. <strong>Operational Handling of Requests.</strong> Data Subjects (such as speakers or Customer admin users) shall exercise their rights (access, rectification, erasure, restriction, objection) primarily vis‑à‑vis the Customer as Controller. Upon the Customer's documented instruction (e.g., via support ticket or email), Nubart will, to the extent technically feasible and taking into account the Service design and the selected retention option, assist the Customer by querying, providing or deleting event‑related Personal Data associated with the relevant event(s) and by confirming completion of deletion within reasonable time. Due to the design of the Service, listener access is anonymous and Nubart cannot identify individual listeners; in such cases, Nubart's assistance is limited to deletion of event‑level Data upon the Customer's instruction.</p>

<h2>6. PERSONAL DATA BREACH</h2>

<p>6.1. Nubart shall notify Customer without undue delay (and in any event within 72 hours) after becoming aware of a Personal Data Breach affecting Customer's Personal Data.</p>

<p>6.2. The notification shall describe the nature of the breach, the categories of data affected, and the measures taken or proposed to address the breach.</p>

<h2>7. AUDIT</h2>

<p>7.1. Upon request, Nubart shall provide Customer with information necessary to demonstrate compliance with this DPA.</p>

<p>7.2. If further verification is required, Customer may conduct an audit (including inspections) at Customer's expense, during normal business hours, and without disrupting Nubart's business operations. Customer shall provide at least 30 days' written notice.</p>

<h2>8. RETURN OR DELETION OF DATA</h2>

<p>8.1. <strong>Data Retention and Deletion</strong>: The retention and deletion of Personal Data is governed by the retention option selected by Customer in the order form at the time of purchase, as detailed in Section 5.3 of the General Terms and Conditions (Immediate Deletion, Deletion Within 30 Days, or Indefinite Retention With Strict Use Limits).</p>

<p>8.2. <strong>Termination of Service</strong>: Upon termination or expiry of the Agreement, Nubart shall, at the choice of Customer and subject to the retention option previously selected:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
  <li>Delete all Personal Data in accordance with the timeframes specified in Section 5.3 of the General Terms and Conditions; or</li>
  <li>Return Personal Data to Customer in a commonly used electronic format, followed by deletion from Nubart's systems.</li>
</ol>

<p>8.3. <strong>Legal Retention</strong>: The above obligations are subject to any requirement under applicable law for Nubart to retain certain Personal Data (e.g., for tax, accounting, or legal compliance purposes).</p>

<p>8.4. <strong>Ad-Hoc Deletion Requests</strong>: Customer may request earlier deletion of Data relating to specific events as provided in Section 5.3 of the General Terms and Conditions, by contacting Nubart Support at info@nubart.eu.</p>

<h2>ANNEX I: DETAILS OF PROCESSING</h2>

<h3>A. List of Parties</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Controller</strong>: The Customer (as identified in the Agreement/Account).</li>
  <li><strong>Processor</strong>: Nubart GmbH or Digital Tangible SL (as applicable).</li>
</ul>

<h3>B. Description of Transfer</h3>

<p><strong>Categories of Data Subjects</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Speakers (Authorized users delivering content).</li>
  <li>Listeners (Anonymous participants receiving content).</li>
  <li>Employees/Contractors of Customer (Admin users).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Categories of Personal Data</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Audio Data</strong>: Voice input from speakers (Transient/Real-time).</li>
  <li><strong>Text Data</strong>: Transcriptions, Translations, Written Questions (Q&A).</li>
  <li><strong>Account Data</strong>: Name, Email, Password (Hashed) for Speakers/Admins.</li>
  <li><strong>Technical and Usage Data</strong>: Timestamps, event identifiers, usage counters (e.g., minutes used per speaker), and similar operational logs. IP addresses are not stored for listeners or speakers; limited IP logging may occur for Nubart's own administrative access and security monitoring.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nature of Processing</strong>: Collection, recording, transmission, translation (via AI), storage, and erasure for the purpose of providing real-time translation services.</p>

<p><strong>Frequency</strong>: Continuous basis during active Events.</p>

<p><strong>Duration</strong>: As determined by the retention policies in the Agreement (default or transient mode) or until deletion is requested.</p>

<h2>ANNEX II: TECHNICAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL MEASURES (TOMs)</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Encryption</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>In Transit</strong>: All data transmission is encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher (HTTPS/WSS).</li>
      <li><strong>At Rest</strong>: Data stored in databases (MongoDB) and file storage (AWS S3) is encrypted using <strong>AES-256.</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Access Control</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Access to production systems is restricted to authorized personnel only.</li>
      <li>Password policies (hashing/salting) are enforced for user accounts.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Physical Security</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Nubart relies on the physical security measures of its Tier-1 cloud providers (AWS, Heroku, MongoDB Atlas) which include 24/7 security and surveillance.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Resilience and Availability</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Regular backups of critical system data (such as account information, configuration, and operational logs). Event transcriptions and translations are included in backups only where they are stored under the selected retention option; in Transient Mode such event content is not stored and therefore not backed up.</li>
      <li>Use of redundant cloud infrastructure to support service availability.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Data Minimization</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Audio data is processed in real-time and not permanently stored as audio files.</li>
      <li>Listener data is anonymous (no login required).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Technical and Usage Data</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Timestamps, event identifiers, usage counters (e.g., minutes used per speaker), and similar operational logs.</li>
      <li>IP addresses of listeners and speakers are not collected or stored. Nubart may log IP addresses only for its own administrative access sessions for security monitoring and system integrity purposes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Environment Separation</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Nubart maintains a separation between production and non‑production environments. Pre‑production and testing environments do not use live customer Personal Data. Customer Personal Data in production is stored in multi‑tenant databases with logical separation and strict access controls appropriate to Nubart's size and risk profile.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Vulnerability and Patch Management</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Nubart operates a lightweight patch and update management process appropriate to its size. Nubart subscribes to release and security notifications for operating systems, frameworks and third‑party libraries used by the Service and applies updates on a regular basis. Vulnerabilities rated as high or critical are prioritised and remediated as soon as reasonably possible, taking into account technical feasibility and impact on Service availability.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Network and Application‑Level Protections</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>To protect the Service against abuse and common web attacks, Nubart applies application‑level rate limiting and monitoring of failed login attempts. Additional network‑ and application‑level protections, including Web Application Firewall (WAF) and DDoS mitigation, are provided by Nubart's cloud hosting platforms (such as Heroku and AWS) as part of their managed, certified infrastructure.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
