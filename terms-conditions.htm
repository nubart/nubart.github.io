                <h2>Nubart’s General Terms of Service</h2>

                <h5>Digital Tangible SL (dba Nubart) - Last updated: December 19th, 2020</h5>
                <div class="text-box3" style="font-size:18px">

                    <h3 id="general" style="color:black" class="fixed-sidebar-target">General - scope of application</h3>
                    <p>These general terms of service apply to all present and future business relations between Nubart and the customer
                        regarding the delivery of products (goods) and the rendering of services (services).</p>

                    <p>The customer within the meaning of these general terms of service is any natural or legal person or company with legal
                        capacity who, at the time of conclusion of this contract, is acting in the exercise of a commercial or independent
                        professional
                        activity.</p>

                    <p>Deviating, conflicting or supplementary general terms of service of the customer shall not become part of the contract,
                        even if known, unless their validity is expressly agreed to in writing. </p>

                    <p> These general terms of service are aimed to cover both tangible products (cards, headphones…) and intangible services (digital
                        services, CMS, content production) provided by Nubart.
                        By confirming an order in writing or by signing a contract, the customer bindingly declares that he wishes to purchase
                        the ordered goods or service. Nubart is entitled to accept or reject the contractual offer contained in the order within four
                        weeks of receipt by Nubart.</p>

                    <p> Confirmation and declaration of acceptance by Nubart shall be made in writing by letter, by e-mail or by a signed contract or
                        agreement. The same shall apply to supplements, ancillary agreements or amendments. The service to be rendered shall be
                        described
                        in detail in the letter of confirmation. The declaration of acceptance by Nubart may also be made by delivery of the tangible
                        goods.</p><br>

                    <h4 style="color:black">Prices, further costs</h4>

                    <p> Nubart’s prices are quoted in EURO or in USD and are to be understood within Spain plus the statutory value added tax. In
                        countries
                        other
                        than Spain, reverse charge will be applied.</p>

                    <p> Nubart shall be bound by the purchase price offered for 90 days, unless otherwise agreed. The date of confirmation is decisive
                        in
                        this respect.</p>

                    <p> Unless expressly agreed otherwise, the prices include packaging, freight, postage and insurance costs inside the
                        European Union. For countries outside the European Union, a separated fee for freight and postage may be applied on the
                        provided
                        quote or agreement.</p><br>

                    <h4 style="color:black">Terms of payment and invoicing</h4>

                    <p> Unless otherwise specified in writing, 50% will be charged at the time of order confirmation and the remaining amount on
                        delivery
                        of the goods.</p>

                    <p> Nubart reserves the right to invoice the agreed service electronically by e-mail.</p>

                    <p> The customer shall only be entitled to set-off if his counterclaims have been legally established or acknowledged by
                        us. The customer may only exercise a right of retention if his counterclaim is based on the same contractual
                        relationship.</p><br>

                    <h4 style="color:black">Cancellation and follow-up costs</h4>

                    <p> Cancellation by the customer shall be subject to consequential costs. The cancellation of an order requires the written
                        form (e.g. letter, e-mail). When cancelling an order, the buyer will be charged the costs incurred up to the time of
                        cancellation.</p>

                    <p> Cancellation of a customer-specific production (for example, card production) involves costs incurred in production
                        preparation,
                        production planning, and release for production. After written approval of production and printing by the customer, 50
                        % of the amount to be invoiced must be paid in full in the event of an intended cancellation, as production can then no longer
                        be
                        stopped.</p>

                    <p> In the event of cancellation of a purchase of merchandise (for example, headphones), the proportionate loss of profit and the
                        costs of reversal to the supplier/manufacturer shall be borne; if the goods are so special that reversal to the manufacturer
                        is
                        not possible (for example, customized headphones), 100% of the invoice amount shall be borne by the buyer. The customer
                        shall receive an invoice from Nubart for the cancellation costs, which shall be settled within 10 days of receipt.</p>
                    <br></div>
                <div class="text-box3" style="font-size:18px">
                    <h3 id="tang-goods" style="color:black" class="fixed-sidebar-target">TANGIBLE GOODS</h3><br>

                    <h4 style="color:black">Delivery and service</h4>

                    <p> An agreement of delivery dates and delivery periods or service dates and service periods shall only come about with the
                        express
                        written confirmation of the date by Nubart.</p>

                    <p> If the customer chooses the right of withdrawal due to Nubart' default, it shall not be entitled to any additional
                        damages. Otherwise, the statutory provisions shall apply.</p>

                    <p> Nubart is entitled to make partial deliveries as far as this is reasonable for the customer.</p><br>

                    <h4 style="color:black">Retention of title</h4>

                    <p> Nubart retains title to the goods until all claims arising from the current business relationship with the customer
                        have been settled in full.</p>

                    <p> The customer is obliged to treat the goods with care.</p>

                    <p> The customer is obliged to inform Nubart immediately of any third partner access to the goods, for example in the event
                        of seizure, as well as of any damage to or destruction of the goods. The customer must notify Nubart immediately of any
                        change of ownership of the goods and of any change of its own domicile.</p>

                    <p> Nubart shall be entitled to withdraw from the contract and demand the return of the goods in the event of breach of contract
                        on
                        the part of the customer, in particular in the event of default in payment or breach of an obligation in this
                        provision.</p>

                    <p> In the case of personalized goods that cannot be further commercialized (such as audio guide cards or personalized
                        headphones),
                        Nubart shall have the right to use the recovered goods as samples and to distribute them on to third parties.</p>

                    <p> The customer shall be entitled to resell the goods in the ordinary course of business as long as he is not in default
                        of payment. Nubart hereby assigns to the other customer all claims in the amount of the invoiced amount, which are due
                        to the other customer against a third partner as a result of the resale. After assignment, the customer is
                        authorized to collect the claim. Nubart reserves the right to collect the claim himself if the customer does not duly
                        fulfill his payment obligations.</p>

                    <p> The handling and processing of the goods by the customer (i.e. by integrating the cards into a card holder) is always
                        carried out in the name and on behalf of Nubart as supplier or manufacturer. If processing takes place with elements that are
                        not
                        the property of Nubart, Nubart shall acquire co-ownership of the new item in the proportion of the value of the goods
                        delivered by
                        Nubart to the processed items. The customer shall keep the (co-)ownership of Nubart in safe custody free of charge.</p>

                    <p> The offers of Nubart are subject to change without notice. Technical changes as well as changes in form, color and/or
                        weight
                        are

                        expressly agreed in writing.</p>

                    <p> For defects in the printed audio guide cards, Nubart shall provide warranty by replacement.</p>

                    <p> A Nubart card is considered defective and subjected to replacement if:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>There is no match between the alphanumeric code and the QR code.</li>
                        <li>The QR code has not been printed in relief despite the customer's explicit written request when placing the order.
                        </li>
                        <li>The colors differ significantly from the design originally approved by the customer.</li>
                        <li>There are completely illegible written parts, as long as Nubart did not warn the customer in advance of this
                            possibility during the elaboration of the design (e.g. too small logos).
                        </li>
                        <li>The cards have been printed on a material other than that explicitly requested by the customer.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p> Minor deviations in the printing ink from the printable original or fluctuations in punching, which lead from card to card
                        to
                        different distances between the printed motifs and the card edges, do not entitle the customer to complain about the
                        delivery.
                        The
                        same applies to the comparison between press proofs and production runs and the comparison between two productions.</p><br>

                    <p> Nubart is committed to guaranteeing the correct operation of 95% of the headphones supplied. The customer accepts the
                        fact that 5% of the headphones may have certain defects, such as:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Absence of one of the silicone hoods</li>
                        <li>Faulty operation of one of the two headphones</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p> Unless otherwise agreed, Nubart undertakes to deliver 5% more than the ordered quantity in order to cover normal
                        waste.</p><br>

                    <h4 style="color:black">Other electronic devices (powerbanks, adaptors)</h4>

                    <p> Nubart is committed to guaranteeing the correct operation of 98 % of the powerbanks and adaptors (i.e. Lightning to 3,5
                        mm-jack
                        adaptor) supplied. The customer accepts the fact that 2% of this product may be defective.</p>

                    <h4 style="color:black">General warranty conditions for tangible goods</h4>

                    <p> The warranty period for new goods vis-à-vis the customer shall be one year from delivery of the goods. This shall not
                        apply if the customer has not notified Nubart of the defect in good time. Warranty is excluded for used goods.</p>

                    <p> If the replacement fails or the delivery time for the replacement is not acceptable for the customer, the contractual
                        partner may, at his discretion, demand a reduction of the remuneration or rescission of the contract (withdrawal). In the
                        event of
                        a minor breach of contract, in particular in the event of minor defects, the customer shall not be entitled to withdraw
                        from the contract.</p>

                    <p>The customer must notify obvious defects (including complaints regarding incorrect or incomplete deliveries) within a
                        period of two weeks from receipt of the goods. In addition, the customer is obliged to notify Nubart in writing of
                        defects that are not obvious within two weeks of discovery. Otherwise, the assertion of a warranty claim shall be excluded
                        in
                        both
                        cases. Timely dispatch of the notice of defect shall suffice to meet the deadline. The customer shall bear the full
                        burden of proof for all claim prerequisites, in particular for the defect itself, for the time of discovery of the defect
                        and
                        for
                        the timeliness of the notice of defect. Nubart reserves the right to inspect any defects complained of on site at the
                        customer's
                        premises by professionally qualified employees.</p>

                    <p>If the customer chooses to withdraw from the contract due to a legal or material defect after failed subsequent
                        performance, he shall not be entitled to any additional compensation claim for damages due to the defect. If the
                        contractual
                        partner chooses to claim damages after failed subsequent performance due to a defect for which Nubart is responsible and
                        if
                        the
                        goods remain with the customer, the damages shall be limited to the difference between purchase price and value of the
                        defective goods, unless Nubart can be accused of malice.</p>

                    <p>Only the product description of Nubart shall be deemed agreed as the quality of the goods. Public statements, praise or
                        advertising
                        by the manufacturer or third parties do not constitute a contractual description of the quality of the goods. In the event
                        of
                        minor deviations of the goods, the customer shall in particular not be entitled to a reduction of the purchase
                        price.</p>

                    <p> The customer's claims for damages due to a defect shall become statute-barred one year after delivery of the goods,
                        unless Nubart can be accused of malice.</p>

                    <p> Nubart follows a zero-downtime approach and the necessary redundancy and automated tests have been established at every
                        level
                        of
                        Nubart’s infrastructure. Therefore Nubart guarantees that its visitor guidance and monitoring system will be perfectly
                        functional
                        99,9 % of the time, except for any unavailability caused by circumstances beyond Nubart’s reasonable control, including
                        without
                        limitation, acts of God, acts of government, floods, fires, earthquakes, civil unrest, acts of terror, strikes or other
                        labor
                        problems (other than those involving Nubart’s employees), Internet service provider failures or delays, or denial of
                        service
                        attacks.</p>

                    <p> In the event of a downtime affecting the functionality of the audio guide due to Nubart’s technical failure of more than
                        20
                        consecutive minutes, the customer may, at his discretion, demand a reduction of the remuneration or rescission of the
                        contract (withdrawal). In the event of a minor downtime of less than 20 consecutive minutes, the customer shall not be
                        entitled to withdraw from the contract.</p>

                    <p> Nubart’s audio cards act as a key that provides a controlled access to a digital web-app and require the use of a
                        smartphone.
                        Nubart’s web-app follows the principle of progressive enhancement in order to ensure the maximal reach. This means that
                        the
                        basic
                        functionalities are available using any browser or internet connection, whereas more nuanced and technically rigorous
                        layers
                        of
                        presentation and features are added progressively only if the end-user's browser/internet connection allows it.</p>

                    <p>Nubart follows a permanent monitoring of all the errors of use due to incompatibilities with certain models of mobile,
                        operating
                        system or browser, establishing the pertinent diagnoses and implementing ways of solution. However, Nubart cannot
                        guarantee
                        that
                        occasional malfunctions will not occur, generally due to the use of very old or uncommon smartphones or browsers.</p>

                    <p> Nubart’s audio guide tracks are streamed by default, but for facilities with bad connectivity Nubart also offers an
                        optional
                        offline-mode. Nubart cannot guarantee an exhaustive functionality of its offline-mode, since with the current state of the
                        art
                        only about 95 % of browsers are compatible with the very advanced technology used for Nubart’s offline-mode. When our
                        system
                        detects a browser that is not compatible with the offline mode, the audio guide issues a warning and switches
                        automatically to
                        Nubart’s standard streaming-mode.</p>

                    <p> The customer agrees on providing a permanent report of the detected incompatibilities by reporting the problem and
                        providing the serial number or the alphanumeric code printed on the card to Nubart, so that Nubart can diagnose the
                        specific
                        problem on its system-logs, detecting the smartphone and browser that has been used and possibly find a correction or
                        workaround
                        to prevent future malfunctions. Nubart agrees to provide a regular feedback to the customer about detected
                        incompatibilities and the measures taken to overcome them.</p>

                    <p> Nubart may agree on providing a direct access to it’s CMS or even to provide a clone of it’s CMS to the customer. Such
                        service would be subjected to a separate special license-agreement.</p>

                    <p> Nubart registers anonymous usage data for its audio guides, like country of origin of the visitor, language of the
                        visitor,
                        total
                        listened minutes, used device, most listened tracks and others. Nubart agrees to provide without previous
                        requirement to the
                        customer a full data report once a month in the case of permanent exhibitions, or one report at the end of a
                        temporary
                        exhibition. Additional data reports will only be provided by Nubart at the express request of the customer and may
                        be
                        invoiced separately. Contractual partners licensed with a direct access to Nubart’s CMS can access data reports
                        without
                        restriction.</p>

                    <p> By default, Nubart currently sends the data reports in PDF format by e-mail. However, Nubart reserves the right to
                        allow
                        another
                        mode of access to these data in the future, such as access to a digital dashboard. Should Nubart provide this type
                        of
                        autonomous
                        access to the customer, Nubart will not be obliged to continue to send proactively the regular data reports.</p>

                    <p> Nubart is constantly innovating in order to provide the best possible experience for its users. The customer
                        acknowledges and agrees that the form and nature of the data reports which Nubart provides may change from time to
                        time
                        without
                        prior notice, always with the aim of improvement.</p>

                    <p> Nubart reserves the right to archive usage-data older than one year. If the contracting party wishes to obtain a
                        usage report
                        that
                        is more than one year old, this request may be subject to surcharge.</p>

                    <p> All data collected by Nubart in the data reports are anonymous. Nubart guarantees that the data compiled on the
                        reports are
                        GDPR-compliant.</p>

                        provide
                        voluntarily
                        some information requested by the customer. The answer or no answer in this form has no effect on the
                        functionality of
                        the audioguide.</p>

                    <p> Nubart offers the customer the possibility to choose between several standard questions for inclusion in the
                        feedback
                        form. Should the customer wish to add a specific question that is not contained in the list, it will be at
                        Nubart's
                        sole discretion to incorporate it and its incorporation may be subjected to a surcharge.</p>

                    <p>This method involves the use of transactional first-party cookies or passive fingerprinting and, optionally, as a

                        functional,
                        and that the privacy of the user is fully respected, in full compliance with the GDPR. The customer will not have

                        possibility
                        of introducing a unique alphanumeric code on a form, either under its own domains nubart.eu or nub.art, or under a

                    <p>In order to meet the different needs of its customers in terms of content production, Nubart has developed three
                        levels of service: bronze, silver and gold.</p>

                    <p>Nubart is committed to producing quality content and using only professional writers, translators and voice talents of
                        proven reliability at all levels of service.</p>

                    <p>The estimates issued by Nubart will specify the level of service offered to the customer. Any change in service level
                        during the production process will be immediately communicated to Nubart, who will invoice the service finally
                        offered. Nubart reserves the right to not accept a change in service level if the corresponding production phase is
                        already too advanced and such change is not possible without incurring costs, unless the customer accepts to pay for
                        those costs.</p>

                    <p>The customer will be able to negotiate with Nubart a hybrid system, applying certain levels of service to different
                        phases of production or to different languages. The production phases are divided into three: script, translation and
                        voiceover.</p>

                    <p>Nubart's calculation of the price of a production will not be the number of words, but the number of soundtracks, each
                        of which should not exceed 350 words. In case they exceed 350 words, Nubart will compute an additional track.</p>

                    <p><b>Service level “Bronze”</b></p>

                    <p>The service level “bronze” covers only the revision of a script previously provided by the customer. This revision
                        will be fundamentally of style and punctuation, seeking to adapt the text to the specific needs of an audio guide. No
                        data checks will be performed, nor will the existing information in the script be completed or altered. The customer
                        will provide the script divided into blocks of no more than 350 words (one block will be equivalent to one
                        soundtrack). In the case that the customer proposes blocks of greater length, Nubart will return the script to the
                        customer or will find a way to divide these blocks into separate tracks, with the consequent surcharge due to the
                        increase in the number of tracks.</p>

                    <p>The service level “bronze” covers a single review by the customer. Nubart will implement the proposed changes and send
                        the script to the customer for final approval before sending it for translation and voiceover. The customer must
                        confirm the approval of the script in writing. Once this approval is given, any change or alteration of the text will
                        be subject to a surcharge that will be proportional to the effort of the translations and voice recordings that have
                        already been made, with a minimum amount of 150 €.</p><br>

                    <p><b>Service Level “Silver”</b></p>

                    <p>The service level "silver" covers the original writing of a script based on written and audiovisual material
                        previously provided by the customer, including personal interviews or video conferences with experts provided by the
                        customer. It does not include original research or factual verification of the information provided by the customer.
                        Nor does it include a "Storyboard" with indication of sound effects.</p>

                    <p>The script will be written by experienced professionals proposed by Nubart. The customer can contribute with generic
                        suggestions about the style (s)he wants to give to the script, as well as receive a sample of the script written by
                        two different professionals, being able to select the one he prefers from the two proposals.</p>

                    <p>The tracks created by the script writer will not exceed 350 words.</p>

                    <p>Once the script is finished, the customer can suggest changes and participate in two rounds of revisions.
                        Once the changes from the second round of revisions are incorporated, the script will be resubmitted for approval. If
                        the customer requests new rounds of revisions, these will be subject to a surcharge.</p>

                    <p>Once the script is completed, it will be sent to the customer for final written approval and will be considered final.
                        Any subsequent change of the final script due to reconsiderations by the customer or errors not attributable to Nubart
                        will imply in all cases a surcharge on the agreed price. This surcharge will be proportional to the effort of the
                        translations and voice recordings that have already been made based on the wrong script, with a minimum amount of 150
                        €.</p><br>

                    <p><b>Service level “Gold”</b></p>

                    <p>The service level "Gold" covers the original writing of a script based on original research. The factual data
                        incorporated into the script will be checked in reliable sources whose reference will be made available to the
                        customer upon request. If required, the script will incorporate a "storyboard" to propose sound effects, as well as
                        dialogues or creative storytelling elements.</p>

                    <p>The script will be written by experienced professionals proposed by Nubart. The customer may provide specific
                        suggestions on the tone (s)he wishes to give the script. The author of the script and the customer will be in
                        permanent communication throughout the process. The customer may make all suggestions and propose all necessary
                        changes until the script is finished, with no limit on revisions.</p>

                    <p>The text created by the script writer per soundtrack or POI will not exceed 350 words.</p>

                    <p>Once the script is finished, it will be sent to the customer for final written approval and will be considered final.
                        Any subsequent changes to the final script due to reconsiderations by the customer or errors not attributable to
                        Nubart will always imply a surcharge on the agreed price. This surcharge will be proportional to the effort of the
                        translations and voice recordings that have already been made, with a minimum amount of 200 €.</p>

                    <p><b>Service level “Bronze”</b></p>

                    <p>The service level "Bronze” covers a translation carried out by trustworthy professionals in their mother tongue. The
                        customer agrees to collaborate with Nubart in resolving any doubts that may arise for the translator, as well as to
                        provide assistance for the translation of technical terms related to their field of expertise. He will also alert
                        Nubart if he has a preference for a particular translation of certain words.</p>

                    <p>Nubart will perform an internal quality control of the translation. This level of service does not include any
                        revision by the customer, so once all the doubts have been resolved and the internal quality control has been carried
                        out, the translation will be sent directly to the voiceover.</p>

                    <p>Nubart will only rectify the translation or the recording based on that translation if the customer can prove that it
                        is a manifest and demonstrable translation mistake or syntax error. Any changes proposed later by the customer based
                        on preferences or subjective criteria will be the object of a surcharge. This surcharge will be proportional to the
                        effort of the voice recordings already made on the basis of the previous translation, with a minimum amount of 150 €.</p><br>

                    <p><b>Service level “Silver”</b></p>

                    <p>The service level “Silver” covers a translation performed by trustworthy professionals in their mother tongue. The

                    <p>The service level “Silver” covers one single review in which the client can propose changes. Nubart will instruct the
                        translator to implement these changes and send the corrected version to the customer for final approval. Any new
                        proposed changes may be subject to a surcharge.</p>

                    <p>Before sending the translation to be voiced, Nubart will request the customer's written approval. Once this approval
                        is granted, any subsequent changes or alterations to the translation will always be subject to a surcharge that will
                        be proportional to the effort of the voice recordings that have already been made, with a minimum amount of 150 €.</p>

                    <p>The customer may choose three voices per language from the collection of voice samples sent by Nubart, indicating
                        their order of preference. Nubart will choose one of those three voice talents based on their availability and
                        suitability for this assignment. Nubart cannot guarantee the hiring of the customer’s first option. The chosen
                        voiceover artists will do the complete voice over of the script in their mother tongue. No more than one voiceover
                        artist per language can be requested at this level of service.</p>

                    <p>Nubart will ensure that the recording does not contain background noise, word changes, repetitions or omissions with
                        respect to the script or to the translation of the script. Likewise, Nubart is committed to providing a pronunciation
                        guide to its speakers to support them in the correct pronunciation of proper names and foreign words, requesting the
                        customer's help when necessary. Nubart will check that the speaker has followed these instructions and has pronounced
                        the words correctly. Although the customer will have the right to demand a correct pronunciation of foreign words, he
                        cannot demand a diction identical to that of a native speaker of the original language.</p>

                    <p>The level of service "bronze" does not include any reviews by the customer. If the customer wishes the tracks to be
                        voiced again due to changes that are not manifest errors by Nubart, the new recording of those tracks will be billed
                        for the same rate applied for the original recording, with a minimum amount of 150 €.</p><br>

                    <p>The customer can choose two voices per language from the collection of voice sample sent by Nubart. Nubart will
                        guarantee the customer's choice, except in case of force majeure or illness. If the chosen voiceover is not hirable
                        due to those reasons, Nubart can substitute him/her with an equivalent voice, subjected to the customer’s approval.
                        Each voiceover artist will voice the part of the script that has been assigned to him/her. Nubart will charge a
                        surcharge for sound editing in case two different voices must be combined in one single track (like in dialogs or
                        quotations).</p>

                        subjective improvements not based on obvious errors by Nubart, the track will be charged at the current rate for the

                    <p> Nubart retains title to the use license for the script, translations and voice-overs produced by Nubart until all
                        claims
                        arising
                        from the current business relationship with the customer have been settled in full. Once the Nubart audio guides
                        are no
                        longer used by the customer and the business relationship between Nubart and the customer can be considered as
                        terminated,
                        ownership of the content will pass to the customer. Only in exceptional cases, such as a revenue-share agreement,
                        can Nubart
                        permanently reserve the intellectual property of the content.</p>

                    <p>Nubart undertakes to establish with the scriptwriters, photographers, translators and speakers the necessary
                        agreements to
                        obtain a
                        permanent license to use their productions in the context of the audio guide and to be in a legal situation to
                        transfer it to
                        the
                        customer.</p></div>

                    <p>The customer may submit to Nubart comments or ideas about Nubart’s audio guiding and monitoring Services, including
                        without limitation how to improve the Nubart Services or products.</p>

                    <p>Nubart undertakes to take notice and to assess the feasibility and convenience of such an idea. If Nubart considers
                        this idea
                        to be
                        an effective and real improvement of its products and services, it will develop and integrate it at no cost to the
                        contractual
                        partner.</p>

                    <p>However, in the event that the customer needs the implementation of such an idea within a shorter period of time
                        than
                        Nubart would require under normal conditions, or if it is an idea that Nubart does not consider a general
                        improvement of the
                        product, but a customized feature only desirable and suitable for the customer, the development of such an idea
                        will be
                        the subject of a separate agreement and will be invoiced.</p>

                    <p>By submitting any Idea, the customer agrees that this disclosure is gratuitous, unsolicited and without restriction
                        and
                        will not place Nubart under any fiduciary or other obligation, and that Nubart is free to use the Idea without any
                        additional
                        compensation to the customer, and/or to disclose the Idea on a non-confidential basis or otherwise to anyone.</p>

                    <p>The customer agrees that Nubart may provide him with notices by email, phone or regular mail, on the Nubart

                        Convention on
                        Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this General Terms of Service. Nevertheless,
                        Nubart reserves
                        the
                        right to choose the law applicable at the domicile of the customer.</p>

                    <p>For any litigation or dispute arising from this Contract, the Courts of Barcelona shall be competent, the parties

                        whatsoever, the
                        remaining agreements and provisions contained herein shall remain in full force and effect, but the Parties agree
                        to replace
                        the
                        void or unenforceable provisions with valid and enforceable provisions that come as close as possible to the
