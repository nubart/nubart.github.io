                    <p><strong>Type of integration:</strong> We do not embed Vimeo videos directly on our website, but use a two-click solution with a lightbox.

                    <p><strong>"Do Not Track" setting:</strong> We have activated the "Do Not Track" option for all our Vimeo videos. This means that Vimeo does not collect any information about you in order to track your viewing behavior or use it for advertising purposes.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Purpose and scope of data processing:</strong> By using the two-click solution and the "Do Not Track" option, data transmission to Vimeo is minimized.

                    <p><strong>Data transfer to the USA:</strong> Please note that Vimeo is based in the USA and data may be transferred there. The USA is currently classified as a country with an inadequate level of data protection according to EU standards.
